== Welcome to Folio
Folio is intended to be an adjunct to an existing website (i.e. definitely not a full fledged CMS), to provide a Portfolio or "Samples of Our Work" section.

When I get around to it I'll start writing more documentation. I guess that would involve doing some development work on Folio, since it's pretty hard to document an app that doesn't exist...
